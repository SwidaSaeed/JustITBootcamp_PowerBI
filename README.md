# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete Power BI development lifecycle — from raw data ingestion to interactive executive dashboard creation.

The objective was to:

- Load and transform structured data  
- Build a semantic data model  
- Develop DAX measures  
- Apply time intelligence calculations  
- Design interactive reports  
- Create high-level performance dashboards  

The final solution provides a comprehensive sales and profitability reporting system designed for business decision-making.

# 🔄 Power BI Development Workflow

### 01 — Get Data  
Import and prepare raw data for analysis.  
• Connect to data sources  
• Import datasets  
• Validate column types  
• Prepare structure for transformation  

---

### 02 — Clean & Transform  
Improve data quality using Power Query.  
• Remove unnecessary columns  
• Rename fields clearly  
• Change data types  
• Filter and clean records  

---

### 03 — Configure Semantic Model  
Build structured relationships between tables.  
• Create table relationships  
• Define one-to-many cardinality  
• Manage cross-filter direction  
• Validate model integrity  

---

### 04 — Create DAX Calculations  
Develop measures and KPIs for reporting.  
• Create Sales, Cost, Profit measures  
• Build KPI metrics  
• Apply aggregation functions  

---

### 05 — Modify Filter Context  
Control how calculations respond to filters.  
• Use `CALCULATE()`  
• Apply custom filter logic  
• Manage row vs filter context  

---

### 06 — Apply Time Intelligence  
Perform period-based trend analysis.  
• Year-to-Date (YTD)  
• Month-to-Date (MTD)  
• Previous Year comparisons  

---

### 07 — Create Visual Calculations  
Present insights using interactive visuals.  
• KPI cards  
• Bar and column charts  
• Line charts  
• Tables and slicers  

---

### 08 — Design & Enhance Reports  
Improve usability and storytelling.  
• Refine layout and spacing  
• Apply consistent formatting  
• Optimise report flow  

---

### 09 — Create Dashboards  
Develop executive dashboards for performance monitoring.  
• Pin key visuals from reports  
• Display KPI summaries  
• Enable interactive filtering  
• Provide performance overview
